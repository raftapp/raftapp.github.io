    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective February 11, 2026 &middot; Last updated February 11, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of the Raft browser extension (&ldquo;Raft,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Extension,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Product&rdquo;), available at <strong>raftapp.io</strong> and through the Chrome Web Store. By installing, accessing, or using Raft, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not install or use the Extension.</p>
    <p>Raft is developed and maintained by <strong>Kevin Raymond</strong> (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;), an independent software developer operating as a Trader under the Chrome Web Store&rsquo;s publisher designation.</p>

    <h2>2. Product Description</h2>
    <p>Raft is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users manage and organize their browser tabs. The Extension is offered under a freemium model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Raft&rsquo;s full feature set for tab management is available at no charge.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro Tier:</strong> A one-time purchase of $25.00 USD unlocks the Cloud Sync feature, granting lifetime access to this capability for as long as the service remains available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Payment and Pricing</h2>
    <p>All payments for Raft Pro are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong> (Lemon Squeezy, LLC), which acts as the Merchant of Record for transactions. When you purchase Raft Pro, your transaction is processed by Lemon Squeezy on our behalf.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li><strong>One-Time Payment.</strong> Raft Pro is a single, one-time purchase of $25.00 USD. There are no recurring fees or subscriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes.</strong> Applicable taxes (including VAT for EU customers) are calculated and collected by Lemon Squeezy at checkout, in accordance with local tax regulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Currency.</strong> Prices are listed in USD. Currency conversion, if applicable, is handled by your payment provider and may include additional fees outside our control.</li>
      <li><strong>Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change pricing at any time. Any price change will not affect purchases already completed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. License</h2>
    <p>Upon installation (Free Tier) or purchase (Pro Tier), we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Extension for personal or commercial use, subject to these Terms.</p>
    <p>You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Extension or its source code.</li>
      <li>Redistribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or sell access to the Extension or any part thereof.</li>
      <li>Modify or create derivative works based on the Extension.</li>
      <li>Use the Extension for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent any access controls, licensing mechanisms, or usage restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>We offer a <strong>14-day refund window</strong> from the date of purchase for Raft Pro. If you are unsatisfied for any reason, you may request a full refund within this period.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li><strong>How to Request a Refund.</strong> Contact us at the email address listed in Section 16 (Contact Information), or initiate a refund through Lemon Squeezy&rsquo;s order management system.</li>
      <li><strong>After 14 Days.</strong> Refund requests made after the 14-day window will be considered on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion.</li>
      <li><strong>Effect of Refund.</strong> Upon refund, your access to the Pro Tier (Cloud Sync) will be revoked. You may continue using the Free Tier.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. EU Consumer Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a consumer in the European Union or European Economic Area, you have a statutory right of withdrawal within 14 days of purchase. Because Raft Pro is a digital product, you acknowledge and agree that by completing the purchase and gaining immediate access to the Pro features, you may lose your right of withdrawal once the digital content has been fully delivered, in accordance with Article 16(m) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU). However, our 14-day refund policy (Section 5) provides equivalent or greater protection.</p>

    <h2>7. Cloud Sync and Data</h2>
    <p>The Pro Tier&rsquo;s Cloud Sync feature transmits certain browser tab data (such as tab URLs, titles, and organizational groupings) to your Google Drive to enable synchronization across devices.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li><strong>Data We Process.</strong> Cloud Sync processes tab metadata necessary to provide the synchronization service. We do not access, store, or transmit browsing history, passwords, form data, or any data beyond what is required for tab synchronization.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Security.</strong> All synced data is encrypted on your device using AES-256-GCM with a password only you know before it leaves your browser. We cannot read your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Deletion.</strong> You may delete your Cloud Sync data at any time by disconnecting from cloud sync in Raft&rsquo;s settings. Upon refund, you should disconnect from cloud sync to remove synced data.</li>
      <li><strong>Local-Only by Default.</strong> The Free Tier operates entirely within your local browser environment. No data is transmitted to external servers unless you activate the Cloud Sync feature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our collection and use of personal data is governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in and to the Extension, including but not limited to its source code, design, graphics, trademarks, and documentation, are and shall remain the sole property of Kevin Raymond. These Terms do not grant you any ownership interest in the Extension. The &ldquo;Raft&rdquo; name and logo are trademarks of Kevin Raymond.</p>

    <h2>10. Availability and Support</h2>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li><strong>Service Availability.</strong> We strive to keep the Extension and Cloud Sync service available, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Extension depends on the Chrome browser platform, and changes to Chrome or the Chrome Web Store may affect functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifetime Access.</strong> &ldquo;Lifetime access&rdquo; means for the commercially reasonable lifespan of the product. If we permanently discontinue the Cloud Sync service, we will provide at least 60 days&rsquo; notice via the email associated with your purchase or through raftapp.io.</li>
      <li><strong>Support.</strong> We provide support on a reasonable-efforts basis. Support requests can be directed to the contact information in Section 16.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source.</strong> Raft&rsquo;s source code, including all Pro features, is publicly available under the MIT License at <a href="https://github.com/raftapp/raft">https://github.com/raftapp/raft</a>. If we permanently cease development or are unable to maintain the Extension, the community is free to fork, modify, and distribute Raft without restriction. Pro purchases support continued development; they do not gate access to proprietary code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, KEVIN RAYMOND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE EXTENSION.</p>
    <p>OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE EXTENSION (I.E., UP TO $25.00 USD).</p>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE EXTENSION IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE EXTENSION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.</p>
    <p>This disclaimer does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer, particularly under EU/EEA consumer protection law.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Extension (including Pro features) if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the Extension is revoked. You may terminate your use at any time by uninstalling the Extension. Sections 9, 11, 12, and 15 shall survive termination.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via raftapp.io or through the Extension itself. Your continued use of the Extension after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the courts of the State of Texas.</p>
    <p>If you are an EU/EEA consumer, you retain the right to bring proceedings in your country of residence, and nothing in these Terms overrides mandatory consumer protection laws applicable in your jurisdiction. EU consumers may also use the European Commission&rsquo;s Online Dispute Resolution platform at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.</p>

    <h2>16. Contact Information</h2>
